cd /Users/alisa/Coding/wind/android
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.6
```

Once you have the gradle-wrapper.jar file, place it in:
```
wind/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
```

After adding the file, your gradle wrapper structure should look like:
```
wind/android/gradle/
├── wrapper/
│   ├── gradle-wrapper.jar    <-- Add this file
│   ├── gradle-wrapper.properties
│   └── libs/
└── ...
```

Would you like me to help you with any of these approaches, or would you prefer to download the file manually?
